		<p>There’s a quote in Jordan and the Middle East that says something along the lines of: “Even when you’re full, you can
			still always eat 40 more bites of food.” And I believe it’s not nearly as shallow as just eating until you are stuffed,
			and then eating some more. But it’s rather a clear reflection on the importance of generosity and hospitality and the
			significance of food in the Jordanian culture (but let’s not get too deep here… it is about eating a lot of food too)!
