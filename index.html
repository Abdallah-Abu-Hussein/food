		<p ">There’s a quote in Jordan and the Middle East that says something along the lines of: “Even when you’re full, you can
			still always eat 40 more bites of food.” And I believe it’s not nearly as shallow as just eating until you are stuffed,
			and then eating some more. But it’s rather a clear reflection on the importance of generosity and hospitality and the
			significance of food in the Jordanian culture (but let’s not get too deep here… it is about eating a lot of food too)!

    <p>Mansaf is a traditional Arab dish made of lamb cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt and served with rice or bulgur. It is a popular dish eaten throughout the Levant. It is considered the national dish of Jordan, and can also be found in Palestine, Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria.</p>

     <p> Kanafeh is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made with shredded filo pastry, or alternatively fine semolina dough, soaked in sweet, sugar-based syrup, and typically layered with cheese, or with other ingredients such as clotted cream or nuts, depending on the region.</p>

    <p>
Falafel, a staple Middle Eastern dish—and a popular street food around the world—that consists of fried spiced balls or patties of ground chickpeas or fava beans (or a mixture of both) stuffed into a pita or wrapped in laffa bread with hot sauce, tahini sauce, and generally some saladlike combination of tomato, lettuce, cucumber, onion, parsley, and yogurt.</p>
